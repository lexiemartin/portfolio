# Lexie Martin's Code Portfolio

Hi there! You've reached the repository for Lexie Martin.

Here are a few samples of coding work I've done in the past. Many of my best projects so far have been done for companies I've worked for in the past.

I've also done lots of work with other coders or learned from helpful strangers on the internet.

Some samples in my portfolio are small sections of code. I've removed protected text or image content. I'm also only posting small but hopefully representative samples.

Thank you for reading this message.

Here's a cat emoticon. Everyone on the internet likes cats, right?
